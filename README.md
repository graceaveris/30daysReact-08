**Day Eight - 30 days of React challenge - "Drink Order" app**

Let's get DRUNK with react!... A simple React.js app as a POS system, like you might find at a bar. Order drinks and then settle your bill.

**Concepts Explored:**
- Using multiple components
- Using multiple functions

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
